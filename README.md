## 🚀 Project: LLM-Powered MiniSpec Code Generation with SITL, YOLO8, and VLM

### **📌 Objective**
To develop an **AI-driven automation system** that generates **MiniSpec code** for drone operations based on **Task Descriptions and Scene Understanding**. This project integrates **Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulation**, **YOLO8 object detection**, and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** to enhance decision-making and real-world applicability.

### **🔗 System Architecture**
#### **1️⃣ Scene Understanding (Perception Layer)**
- Capture real-world or simulated images from the **SITL drone environment**.
- Use **YOLO8** for **object detection**, identifying and labeling scene elements.
- Use a **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** (e.g., **LLAMA3.2-Vision, Llava**) to process the image and generate a **structured Scene Description**.

#### **2️⃣ Contextual Reasoning (LLM Processing Layer)**
- Combine the **Task Description** (user-defined instruction) and **Scene Description** (generated by YOLO8 + VLM).
- Process the input using **LLAMA3.3 (or GPT-4 API)** to generate a **MiniSpec command** that aligns with the task and environmental context.

#### **3️⃣ Action Execution (Simulation & Validation Layer)**
- Validate the generated **MiniSpec code** using a **Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) drone simulation**.
- Simulate real-world execution before deployment to ensure reliability and accuracy.
